# Stark252

This crate provides an implementation for arithmetic operation in the field of the stark252 curve which is a STARK-friendly curve. The fields defined here are further used in stark152 curve's implementation. These fields are :
* $\ F_p$ with p = 3618502788666131213697322783095070105623107215331596699973092056135872020481 of 252-bit.
* Scalar field($\ F_{q}$) of prime order with characteristic q = 3618502788666131213697322783095070105526743751716087489154079457884512865583 of 252-bit.

It also contains implementation for algebraic hash functions defined over the base field of stark252 curve.
